# Pubmed2Wikipedia #
Pubmed2Wikipedia transforms a set of articles from pubmed into an entry for wikipedia.


## About ##
First, the user select a set of articles about a given subject from http://www.pubmed.org the software then download, prepare and format the data for a new wikipedia page.

For example it creates the 'references' part and suggest the Categories from the Mesh terms.

I've also included a dictionary (see menu 'File') which recognizes some regex patterns to help create a wikipedia internal link. This dictionary can be saved using the "File" menu.

Use the right click of your mouse to open a contextual menu (formatting commands, suggestion s of links, add a pattern...)
